JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.

ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

1. HTML to define the content of web pages

2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const

x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;

x stores the value 5
y stores the value 6
z stores the value 11

When to Use var, let, or const?

1. Always declare variables

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use let if you can't use const

5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

Note
Variables are containers for storing values.
